Naik Urba Datt was born in the picturesque town of Pithoragarh, Uttarakhand, to Shri Ram and Rama Devi. Growing up in the majestic Himalayas, Naik Urba Datt was instilled with values of courage, sacrifice, and patriotism.

As he grew older, Naik Urba Datt's passion for serving his country only intensified. He joined the Indian Army, determined to protect his nation and its people from harm.
<br><br>
In 1998, Naik Urba Datt's unit, 3 Kumaon, was deployed in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, to counter the growing terrorist threat. On February 23, 1998, his team received specific intelligence that a group of terrorists was hiding in Saloor village, planning to attack a convoy of VIPs passing through the area.

Without hesitation, Naik Urba Datt and his team sprang into action. Under the cover of darkness, they swiftly cordoned off Sofi Mohalla in Saloor village, ensuring that the terrorists had no escape route. The search operation began, with Naik Urba Datt leading the charge.
<br><br>
As the sun rose over the horizon the next morning, Naik Urba Datt and his team continued their search. They had been searching for hours, but Naik Urba Datt's determination never wavered. Suddenly, while searching the last house in the locality, he noticed some suspicious movement in the heap of hay on the rooftop.
<br><br>
In a split second, Naik Urba Datt swung into action. He immediately opened fire, but the terrorists were quick to react. They jumped off the rooftop into the nearby Nala and began to flee towards the jungle of Brari Nambal.
<br><br>
Without caring for his own safety, Naik Urba Datt jumped into the Nala and chased after the terrorists. Despite being severely injured, he gunned down one militant and wounded another, who later succumbed to his injuries.

However, Naik Urba Datt's bravery came at a great cost. He succumbed to his injuries and was martyred, leaving behind a legacy of courage and sacrifice. His actions that day inspired his comrades and earned him the Shaurya Chakra gallantry award posthumously on January 26, 1999.
<br><br>
Naik Urba Datt's story serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by India's brave soldiers, who put their lives on the line to protect their country and its people. His bravery and devotion to duty will always be remembered as an inspiration to future generations.
